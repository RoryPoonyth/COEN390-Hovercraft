# Miniature Hovercraft Project - ENGR 290
Overview

This project involves designing, building, and programming a miniature hovercraft as part of the ENGR 290 course. The goal was to integrate principles of engineering design, aerodynamics, and coding to create a functional, autopilot hovercraft using Arduino.

Our hovercraft is capable of smooth navigation, obstacle avoidance, and stable hovering over flat surfaces. The project emphasizes teamwork, hands-on fabrication, and applying theoretical concepts to a practical engineering challenge.
